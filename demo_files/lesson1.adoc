= Lesson 1: Introduction to the +\1+ Statement in Python

The +\1+ statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

== Basic Syntax

The syntax of an +\1+ statement in Python is:

[source,python]
----
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
----

For example:

[source,python]
----
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
----

== Using +\1+

You can also use an +\1+ clause to run a block of code when the condition is false:

[source,python]
----
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
----

== Using +\1+

When you need to check multiple conditions, use +\1+ (short for "else if"):

[source,python]
----
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Keep studying!")
----

== Indentation Matters

Python relies on indentation (spacing) to define code blocks. Make sure you use consistent indentation, typically 4 spaces.

Incorrect example:

[source,python]
----
if True:
print("This will cause an error")
----

Correct example:

[source,python]
----
if True:
    print("This is properly indented")
----

== Summary
* Use +\1+ to check conditions.
* Combine with +\1+ or +\1+ for more complex logic.
* Always pay attention to indentation in Python!

Happy coding!
